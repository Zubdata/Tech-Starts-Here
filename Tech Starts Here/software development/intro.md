# Application development

Application development, often referred to as software development, is the process of creating software applications that serve specific functions or solve particular problems. Application developers, also known as software developers, play a crucial role in designing, coding, testing, and maintaining these applications.

- ### Main Branches of Application Development

    1. #### Web Development:
        Web developers create websites and web applications that users access through web browsers.

        <br>
        ##### What to learn?
        Game development languages and engines vary, with popular choices being Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++), and Godot (GDScript).

    5. #### Embedded Systems Development
        Embedded systems developers work on software that runs on specialized hardware devices, such as IoT (Internet of Things) devices, automotive systems, and industrial machines.
        <br>
        ##### What to learn?
        Programming languages like C and C++ are commonly used.


    

    
    The choice of language and stack depends on the specific needs and goals of the development project. Developers often select technologies that align with the platform, scalability requirements, and features of the application they are building.
